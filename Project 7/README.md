# What is a VPC?

A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) in AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a service that allows you to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you define. Here are the key components and features of an AWS VPC:

1. **Subnets**: A VPC can be divided into multiple subnets, which are sections of the VPC IP address range where you can place groups of isolated resources. Subnets can be either public (with access to the internet) or private (isolated from the internet).

2. **IP Addressing**: You can choose your own IP address range for the VPC using IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

3. **Route Tables**: Control the routing of network traffic within the VPC and between subnets. You can create custom route tables to direct traffic as needed.

4. **Internet Gateway**: A VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. You need to attach an Internet Gateway to a VPC to enable internet access for your instances.

5. **NAT Gateway and NAT Instances**: These allow instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services without exposing themselves to incoming traffic from the internet.

6. **Security Groups**: Act as virtual firewalls for your instances to control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.

7. **Network ACLs (Access Control Lists)**: Provide an additional layer of security, controlling traffic at the subnet level.

8. **VPC Peering**: Allows you to connect one VPC with another VPC to route traffic between them using private IP addresses.

9. **VPN Gateway**: Enables you to establish a secure connection between your VPC and your on-premises network.

10. **VPC Endpoints**: Allow you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an Internet Gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.

11. **AWS Direct Connect**: Provides a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS, enhancing security and reducing network costs.



# Understand VPC Requirements
As a DevOps engineer, you need to understand the VPC requirements by asking questions to the relevant teams.

When working in real projects, following are some of the important questions that will help you understand the VPC requirements better.

1. Identifying Your Hosting Needs: What do you want to host?
2. Meeting Compliance Standards: What are its compliance requirements?
3. Handling Sensitive Information: Does it have applications dealing with PCI/PII data?
4. Public vs. Private Accessibility: Are the applications internet-facing?
5. Connecting to On-Premise Systems: Does the VPC require a Hybrid connectivity to an on-premise environment? If yes, is it DNS or IP-based connectivity?
6. User Accessibility to VPC Services: How are users going to connect to the services hosted in VPC?
7. VPC to VPC Connectivity: Does it need access to services hosted on other VPCs that are part of organizations network?
It is always best to document these requirements.

Note: Organizations typically keep a questionnaire to understand the VPC requirements from network, security, and compliance perspectives.

# VPC Network Design
Ideally in most organizations the VPC is created and managed by a dedicated Network team. However, devops engineers working with the application team need to come up with the VPC requirements that can host all the required applications.

### How to choose CIDR for VPC?
The CIDR block for a VPC depends on the number of servers we plan to deploy in a VPC. This includes both self-hosted and AWS-managed services

We not only consider the immediate requirements but also the future expansion. We might start with a total of 15 servers now and in the future, it might grow to 1000+ servers.

So for our requirement, 10.0.0.0/20 CIDR is more than enough. Which would give you 4,096 usable IP addresses. We also need to factor on subnets in different availability zones.

However, for the project, we will choose the 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR range for our VPC. This will allow you up to 65,536 private IP addresses and it will make the subnetting easier.

Note: In actual project environments, VPC ranges are decided only based the requirements. Typically, the Application/DevOps/Network team will have a discussion and decide on the required ranges so that over/under allocation doesn’t happen

### Avoiding IP Address Conflicts
Let’s take a scenario where 10.0.0.0/16 range is already allocated to a project in an on-prem environment. Even if there is no hybrid cloud connectivity to on-prem, we should not re-use 10.0.0.0/16 for VPC. Because in the future, if hybrid connectivity is set up, it could lead to IP conflicts.

Network teams in organizations ensure there are no IP range conflicts by keeping track of private IP addresses reserved for projects. This way, there won’t be any IP conflicts. Typically they use IP Address Management (IPAM) tools to track IP address allocation. These tools provide a centralized view of the IP address space used within the organization.

The following image shows an example dashboard of an open-source IPAM tool called Netbox.


Note: If you use AWS Private NAT gateway you can avoid IP conflicts even if two VPCs have the same CIDR ranges.

## Subnet Design
Based on our application architecture and components we would need the following public and private subnets.

1. Public Subnets (Public): To deploy Load balancers for the Java app autoscaling group
2. Application Subnets (Private): To deploy the Java app autoscaling group
3. Database Subnets (Private): To deploy the RDS MYSQL instance
4. Management Subnets (Private): To deploy CI/CD tools and platform tools.
5. Platform Tools Subnets (Private): To deploy and manage all the platform tools.

## Private Subnet Access
Since we have private subnets, DevOps engineers & developers need access to the servers on private subnets.

Most organizations set up a VPN connection to the AWS cloud to access the servers deployed in VPC.

Following are the native-options for connecting instances in the AWS VPC private subnets.

1. EC2 Instance Connect: Helps you to connect to AWS instances in a private subnet securely without needing a Public IP. It is an identity-aware proxy that uses IAM permissions to connect to the instance. One instance can be used as a JUMP server to connect to other instances in the VPC (cheapest solution)
2. AWS Client VPN (client-to-site VPN): Allows remote workers to access AWS resources securely; Ideal for a distributed team that needs to use AWS services. (Gets expensive with more users)
3. Site-to-Site VPN: Connects the on-premises network to the AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC); This is the ideal solution for organizations that want a secure, private connection between their on-prem network and AWS. Requires an on-premises VPN device. Setup can be expensive.
4. AWS Direct Connect: Creates a direct, private link between the on-prem and AWS network; It is ideal for businesses that need a fast, reliable connection to AWS without using the public internet. It comes with a higher upfront costs.
Note: The type of access depends on the project requirements, compliance requirements, and budget.

## Internet Access
Both Private and Public subnet servers need internet access.

If you add an internet gateway, your subnet becomes a public subnet. Others by default become private.

Therefore, we need add a internet gateway to the public subnet for direct internet inbound access for instances in the public subnet.

Other subnets need to be in private. For the private subnets to access the internet (outbound), you need to attach a NAT gateway. This is primarily required to access thrid party services or package repositories available in internet.

## Egress Filtering
Most organizations use a forward proxy for all outbound internet requests from Private & public subnets. Meaning, that even though we have a NAT gateway, there would be a firewall service to filter the outbound traffic.

AWS offers a service called AWS Network Firewall, which can be integrated with a NAT gateway for egress traffic filtering. You can restrict or filter HTTP and HTTPS traffic using domain names.

Some organizations use self-managed Squid Proxies for DNS filtering. Big organizations use enterprise solutions like Checkpoint for ingress & egress filtering.

All outgoing requests first hit the proxy, get filtered, and then go out through the NAT gateway.

## VPC Documentation
One of the key things in VPC design is documentation. All VPC configurations should be documented to ensure the VPC stays compliant over time.

You can choose a documentation method of your choice. It could be an Excel sheet, confluence documentation, or GitHub Markdown documentation.

Now that we have a good understanding of the VPC requirements for our project, let’s document the required subnets and CIDRs.

VPC Details
Following are the VPC details, region, and availability zones we will be using for our project.

1. CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16
2. Region: us-west-2
3. Availability Zones: us-west-2a, us-west-2b, us-west-2c
4. Subnets: 15 Subnets (One per availability Zone)

# STEP 1

Let's create a VPC for our project and assign attach an internet gateway to it

- Login to your AWS management console and search VPC

![alt text](images/search_and_create_VPC.png)
![alt text](<images/add name and ipv4cidr.png>)
![alt text](<images/create vpc.png>)

- Now we create an Internet Gateway
![alt text](<images/create IGW step 1.png>)

![alt text](<images/create IGW step 2.png>)

![alt text](<images/create IGW step 3.png>)

![alt text](<images/create IGW step 4.png>)

![alt text](<images/create IGW step 5.png>)


We will follow the following subnet naming schemes
```
EnvName-AppType-RouteType-AZ
```
For example,
```
Prod-Web-Public-2a
```


Let's create some subnet
- Public Subnets

| Subnet Name          | Availability Zone | CIDR Block  | Type   |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| Prod-Web-Public-2a   | us-west-2a        | 10.0.0.0/28  | Public |
| Prod-Web-Public-2b   | us-west-2b        | 10.0.0.16/28 | Public |
| Prod-Web-Public-2c   | us-west-2c        | 10.0.0.32/28 | Public |

## Using the above table data, we will create the public subnet
![alt text](<images/create subnet.png>)

![alt text](<images/creaqte public ssubnet2a.png>)
![alt text](<images/creaqte public ssubnet2a complete.png>)
![alt text](<images/creaqte public ssubnet2b1.png>)
![alt text](<images/creaqte public ssubnet2b2.png>)
![alt text](<images/creaqte public ssubnet2c.png>)
![alt text](images/createPublicSubnet.png)

# Using the above steps,  create the other subnets with the data below 

- Application Subnets

| Subnet Name          | Availability Zone | CIDR Block  | Type    |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| Prod-App-Private-2a  | us-west-2a        | 10.0.0.48/28 | Private |
| Prod-App-Private-2b  | us-west-2b        | 10.0.0.64/28 | Private |
| Prod-App-Private-2c  | us-west-2c        | 10.0.0.80/28 | Private |

- Database Subnets

| Subnet Name         | Availability Zone | CIDR Block  | Type    |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| Prod-DB-Private-2a  | us-west-2a        | 10.0.0.96/28 | Private |
| Prod-DB-Private-2b  | us-west-2b        | 10.0.0.112/28 | Private |
| Prod-DB-Private-2c  | us-west-2c        | 10.0.0.128/28 | Private |

- Management Subnets

| Subnet Name           | Availability Zone | CIDR Block   | Type    |
|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------|---------|
| Prod-Mgmt-Private-2a  | us-west-2a        | 10.0.0.144/28 | Private |
| Prod-Mgmt-Private-2b  | us-west-2b        | 10.0.0.160/28 | Private |
| Prod-Mgmt-Private-2c  | us-west-2c        | 10.0.0.176/28 | Private |

- Platform Subnets

| Subnet Name              | Availability Zone | CIDR Block   | Type    |
|--------------------------|-------------------|--------------|---------|
| Prod-Platform-Private-2a | us-west-2a        | 10.0.0.192/28 | Private |
| Prod-Platform-Private-2b | us-west-2b        | 10.0.0.208/28 | Private |
| Prod-Platform-Private-2c | us-west-2c        | 10.0.0.224/28 | Private |


##  This is how it should look like after you create all the subnets
![alt text](<images/All subnet created.png>)

# Route Table Design
For each subnet group, we will create a custom route table and assign rules required for the specific subnets.

For example, all three public subnets will share the same public-subnet route table.


| Subnet      | Destination CIDR | Target           |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| Public      | 0.0.0.0/0        | Internet Gateway |
| App         | 0.0.0.0/0        | Nat Gateway      |
| DB          | 0.0.0.0/0        | Nat Gateway      |
| Management  | 0.0.0.0/0        | Nat Gateway      |
| Platform  | 0.0.0.0/0        | Nat Gateway      |


Using the table above you will create 5 route tables

- Let's create public route table
![text](<images/create RT.png>)
- Give it a name and select the VPC you created earlier
![text](images/createRT1.png)
- Let's assocaite our public subnet to our route table
![text](images/createRT2.png)
![text](images/createRT3.png)
- We add 3 public subnets (prod-web-public a,b,c)
![text](images/createRT4.png)

# Using the table and steps above create the other route tables and their subnet association

### When you completly create all 5 it would look like this:

![alt text](<images/All route tables.png>)

## NAT Gateway

A NAT gateway is a Network Address Translation (NAT) service. You can use a NAT gateway so that instances in a private subnet can connect to services outside your VPC but external services cannot initiate a connection with those instances.

We need to create a NAT gateway and attach it to all our route tables created earlier
![text](<images/create NAT gatewa.png>)

- select a subnet and allocate an elastic ip

![text](<images/create NAT gateway 1.png>)

###  Now we will add the NAT gateway to our route tables one by one:
![alt text](<images/add NGW to route.png>)
- add route to each route table , we are adding to platorm route table now
![alt text](<images/add NGW to route2.png>)
- for Destination select 0.0.0.0/0
![alt text](<images/add NGW to route3.png>)
- for the Target selct NAT gateway
![alt text](<images/add NGW to route4.png>)
- select the NAT gateway created earlier and save changes
![alt text](<images/add NGW to route5.png>)
- Notice the status of the NAT gateway it's active
![alt text](<images/add NGW to route6.png>)


### Do the above steps for the other route tables ie for the DB, APP, MANAGEMENT ROUTE TABLES

If you noticed we did not do anything to our public subnet we want to route traffic uing a service called internet gateway so let's attach it to the  public route table
![alt text](<images/attach IGW to public route table.png>)
![alt text](<images/attach IGW to public route table1.png>)
![alt text](<images/attach IGW to public route table2.png>)
![alt text](<images/attach IGW to public route table3.png>)
![alt text](<images/attach IGW to public route table4.png>)
![alt text](<images/attach IGW to public route table5.png>)



# AWS VPC Topology
The following diagram shows the high-level VPC topology for our design.

Note: Both the internet Gateway (IGW) and NAT gateway(NAT-GW) gets deployed in the public subnet.

To check our VPC topology:

# Network ACLs

Network access control list (NACL) is the native VPC functionality to control the inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.

In our architecture, the connection to the DB subnet should be allowed only from the App subnet and management subnet. The public subnet should not have direct access to the DB subnet.

The following are the tables for inbound and outbound rules for the DB NACL.

# DB NACL (Inbound Rules)

| Rule Number | Type       | Protocol | Port Range | Source IP   | Allow/Deny |
|-------------|------------|----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| 100         | Custom TCP | TCP      | 3306       | 10.0.0.96/28 | Allow     |
| 110         | Custom TCP | TCP      | 3306       | 10.0.0.112/28 | Allow    |
| 120         | Custom TCP | TCP      | 3306       | 10.0.0.128/28 | Allow    |
| *           | All Traffic| All      | All        | 0.0.0.0/0   | Deny       |


# DB NACL (Outbound Rules)


| Rule Number | Type       | Protocol | Port Range | Destination IP | Allow/Deny |
|-------------|------------|----------|------------|----------------|------------|
| 100         | Custom TCP | TCP      | 3306       | 10.0.0.192/28    | Allow    |
| 110         | Custom TCP | TCP      | 3306       | 10.0.0.208/28    | Allow    |
| 120         | Custom TCP | TCP      | 3306       | 10.0.0.224/28    | Allow    |
| *           | All Traffic| All      | All        | 0.0.0.0/0        | Deny     |


 The above table serves as a guide to how your implemetation would look like:
